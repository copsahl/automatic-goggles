# Automatic Goggles

Easily manage remote sessions, run pre-configured missions, all in one place!

## How does this work?

When attacking some sort of application, it's always a goal to get a shell on a system to strengthen your foothold. This is where automatic goggles will help you out! Whether you are able to execute commands via command injection, or file upload, you can always count on automatic goggles for quick and simple connections. You can connect directly to a listener you started on the target, or set up a listener with automatic goggles to retrieve a reverse shell. And from there it's very simple to drop into a shell and run commands manually or run pre-configured missions against a target node. Here is a very helpful list of [reverse shells](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) you can employ (not my own, but I use it all the time).

## Future Additions
- Config file for specifying connections, nodes, and missions to run automatically.
- Upload/Download files.

## FAQ
- *Why would I want to use automatic goggles over other solutions?*
  - I believe that automatic goggles makes handling multiple sessions simple and easy. And it has the unqiue ability to run preconfigured missions with scripts you create yourself (or use the ones I've made even though they aren't super helpful).
- *What do you think is the best part about automatic goggles right now?*
  - I personally think the best (and also the coolest) part about automatic goggles is running different mission scripts. And the even better part is that they are literally so easy to make! They are very basic right now, but they will allow you to run missions on a few nodes at a time while also manually dropping into a shell on other nodes.
